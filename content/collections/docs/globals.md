## Overview

Globals are designed for reusable content, such as:

- Company info
- Footer and sidebar content
- Customer quotes or testimonials
- Site settings (e.g. on/off switches for various features)
- Success and/or error message text

You can create multiple Globals sets in `site/content/globals`, or `Configure » Content » Globals` in the control panel.

Variables set inside your default set (`global.yaml`) will simply be available in all your templates by their variable name. Each set/file becomes its own scope, allowing you to group your Globals together logically. For example, all of the variables inside a `footer.yaml` file will be accessed through `{{ footer:var_name }}`.
